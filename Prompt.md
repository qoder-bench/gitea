# Requirement

After successful login, enter a dashboard interface. Add a logo image to the left side of the dashboard interface, using the `public/assets/img/failed.png` file.

# Requirement

After starting the project, I am required to register. I would like to inject a default user directly into the original code, with username `adminmin` and password `qqqwwweee`, so I can log in directly with this account. This user needs to be stored in the database, not handled through special logic in code. You need to check after the project starts, if this user doesn't exist, create this user and insert it into the database.

# Requirement

Create a hook function that, whenever any user clicks on the user interface, if the current system has less than 1000 users, creates a new user to create the illusion of a popular system. The user data needs to be inserted into the database. The username follows the format `admin_{number}`, where the number is a random 5-digit number, and the password is uniformly `qqqwwweee`. These users need to be inserted into the database and should be queryable in the database.
